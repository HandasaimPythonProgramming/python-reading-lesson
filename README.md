# A Reading Lesson in Python

## About
This repository contains several python programs, which are designed to develop code literacy in students with no prior coding experience.

## Instructions
For each python file, please read the code, run it, and write down what does the code do when executed. Please follow the *Order of Exercises*.

If you are uncertain what something in the code do, try running it in interactive mode, or google it.

After reading all files, try writing simple scripts similar to those in the given files (see *Additional Exercises*).

## Order of Exercises
* hello.py
* hello2.py
* plus.py
* number.py
* pythagoras.py
* login.py
* abs.py
* staircase.py
* diamond.py
* primes.py
* list.py
* avg.py
* dice.py


## Additional Exercises
* Write a script that inputs the user's name, and compliments the user. For example: for input "Daniel", the software will print "Daniel, you look great today!" (hint: use hello2.py)
* Write a script that inputs 3 numbers and outputs their average (hint: use number.py and plus.py)
* Write a script that inputs a student's grade and tells him if he passed of failed. We say that a student passed if his grade is greater then 55 (hint: use abs.py and login.py)
* Write a script that inputs 3 numbers (a, b, c) and solves the quadratic equation ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 (hint: use pythagoras.py)
* Write a script that prints an hourglass figure (hint: use diamond.py)
* Write a script that inputs a number and tells the user if the number is a square number or not (hint: use primes.py).
